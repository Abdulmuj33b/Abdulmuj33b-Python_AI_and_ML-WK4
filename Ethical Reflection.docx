When deploying a predictive model trained on the Kaggle Breast Cancer dataset (or any dataset) in a company, it is crucial to consider potential biases. For example, if the dataset underrepresents certain groups (such as specific teams, demographics, or regions), the model may perform poorly for those groups, leading to unfair or inaccurate predictions. This can result in some employees or teams being systematically assigned lower or higher priorities, which could affect resource allocation, morale, and trust in the system.
To address these issues, fairness tools like IBM AI Fairness 360 (AIF360) can be used. AIF360 provides a suite of metrics to detect and quantify bias in datasets and model predictions. It also offers algorithms to mitigate bias, such as reweighting data, modifying labels, or adjusting model outputs. By integrating such tools into the model development pipeline, organizations can identify and reduce unfair disparities, ensuring that the predictive system treats all groups equitably. This not only improves the ethical standing of the AI system but also enhances its reliability and acceptance among users.
